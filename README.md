# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. By leveraging historical customer data, including usage patterns, demographics, and service subscriptions, the model will identify customers at risk of churning. This prediction will enable the company to reduce attrition rate.
